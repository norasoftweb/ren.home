					<h3>I want to use this section to talk about some things that once worked on this website that no longer exist.</h3>
                    <h3>Back then you could create a account here and interact with me, leaving comments or directly ask me questions in the faq section. However i got rid of that when i switched to github since it does not support databases or php and all that. Wich is fine by me.</h3>
                    <h3>This website had flash animations uploaded on it at some point, must have been from 2021-2022. I had my own little archive of flash animations i made, collected and found. Most of it was porn tho.</h3>
                    <h3>My Page required a password to get onto it back then, literally you needed a passcode to enter the page. If you had a account that i personally verified you could just use that to skip the passcode.</h3>
                    <h3>Since my website was used for many other things and not just being used as my own blog, i offered a wide range of software you could not really find anywhere else that easily. But other pages did a better job on that so i stopped doing that in 2023. Was mostly just valve stuff like old game builds or E3 demos.</h3>
                    <h3>This Page had a built in videoplayer and videosection back in 2023-2024. It was basically like my own personal youtube in wich i basically uploaded porn of my now ex and me. Recieved a lot of good comments and reviews! Maybe i should bring that back, who knows.</h3>
