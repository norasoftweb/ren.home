					<h3>I am currently working on getting most of the content i uploaded here back then back on here. I really want to recover most of it and archive anything i can find from back then. It will probably be harder than i think but i hope i will manage to find enough stuff to feed you guys with some content.</h3>
                    <h3>Most of you know about the old content anyway since most of you are here since the beginning, actully insane how many people use this website just because they are interested in how fucked up i am and how fucked up my life is lmao.</h3>
