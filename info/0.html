					<h3>This website wasn't always called ren.home! It started as "Nuki's Blogventure" on which i just blogged normally for almost 1 year.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>After that it got renamed to "The Queenston Lair" wich it was named for almost 2 years. And after that it got the name we know today, just a different domain. Since i used a different hosting service back then. I used cloudfare but at somepoint switched to github because it was easier and cheaper(free).</h3>
                    <br> 
                    <h3>I think i will leave the name as it is forever most likely. I think ren.home is a short but fitting name for this project of mine.</h3>
