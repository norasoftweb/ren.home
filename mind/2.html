                <h3>Yeah seeing the title of this file it might look strange or even disturbing but I can explain, don’t worry.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Me and my ex broke up over a year ago and I think it was for the better, I would even say I know it was. Even though we had difficult and hard times, we both were sexually very active. It was a long distance relationship but we managed to make the best out of it. At least sexwise.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>He was such a whore, a slut, liked to present himself online and more. He said he would like to find out how people tasted, he wanted to try as many different peoples cum as he can. Idk I found that so hot at the time(still do), but yeah. We jerked off in call together every day, he stripped, showed me his ass here and there was begging for it basically. We both were constantly horny together simping on each other too.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>With my current partner I could only wish for something like that. While yeah I love my partner, we arent anywhere near as lewd as I was with my ex. And to be honest with you, as someone that really likes to be intimate, this hurts. You surely cant force anyone to do anything I know that so I will most likely work something out since my partner has no interest in much sexual stuff.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>I either find a way to solve it while staying in the relationship or I quit the relationship. I am not a terrible human being I would finish it before going back to my old life. I think it would be a fair way to do it like this.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>It would nice if I could be anywhere near as horny and lewd with my current partner it would be more than the better choice, but I already talk about it a lot trying to fix it. And as I said you can not force someone into it so that is not an option to me anymore. I don’t have many things left I could try. I tried and I am not saying it’s over yet, however I should slowly start thinking about how to end this all in a respectful manner.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>This all just really keeps me down mentally at the moment since I know this will not end well but I just don’t know how I will end it. I don’t want this to end but if I keep being in this relationship with almost 0 sexual interactions I will do stupid things someday, so I am realistic and probably putting an end to it. Even tho I really don’t want it, there probably is no way to save this. Intimacy is so important to me and I don’t have that much right now. I miss that about my ex.</h3>
