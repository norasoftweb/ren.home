                <h3>Well I am gonna be honest my current relationship is not going to well if I’m honest. That gots several reasons and I pretty much tried everything I can for now. I talked I did this, did that but none of it seems to work so I gave up. I already gave up earlier this week.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>I am now considering dating again because brother I am 20 years old I want a partner for life now and not someone that isn’t fitting. I want someone who really likes me and I can start a family with at some point. But with the current relationship, that probably ain’t gonna happen.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>I don’t wanna sound like I blame my partner for everything, because I know I do stuff wrong too and I admit that yes. But he does stuff wrong, denies it and then when I ask him to change certain things gets pissed at me for wanting to make this relationship futureproof.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Seriously kind of breaks my heart since I invested a lot of mental health in this and trying to kinda trust him, but it really seems like he doesn’t want me or doesn’t like me. Which I do not blame him for, I get it yeah. But I need someone who does at this point.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Really makes me sad that I will have to do this but he doesn’t care and I cannot make him care. I do care, but there is just things even I cannot do. So I do the smartest thing wich is moving on and going my way. Still sad and I am not 100% if I should do this but talking doesn’t help so I don’t know what else to do. I ran out of options.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>I had a lot of things planned that I wanted to do with them, but it never came that far. How can you love someone that permanently thinks you want to hurt them or piss them off. You can’t.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>We are like 0 intimate when we text or call, and whenever we see each other irl we do boring shit that is always the same, I complained about that half a year ago already but still same. Not blaming him but yeah, not for me.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>I know they will read this and probably burst into anger again, but I honestly tried. I will talk about this maybe irl but at this point I think I should see other people, even tho I would have loved this to work out. This guy was my highshool crush, the one that turned me on back then by joken about having sex with me and all that. The one guy I simped on for years, but I didn’t knew how he was in private and maybe thats why I did that.  </h3>
                <br>
                <h3>He stresses me out so much, and again I am not trying to look like the victim here, I am just weak thats all. I cannot stand pressure from someone, I see it as torture, it feels like he is trying to get me to commit self harm to myself at this point and I don’t want to hurt myself. I want to be happy and have someone I can have fun with, cuddle, kiss. That shows me I really matter to them, that values my affection and love, that loves me.</h3>
