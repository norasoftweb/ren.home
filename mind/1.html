                    <h3>Basically it was my birthday not too long ago.
                        Usually my bf comes here or i go to him every weekend (changes every week) but the weekend after my birthday we didn't meet :) even tho i visited him on his birthday last year. He didn't visit me tho. Sure he argues that its because of weather and trains not going (wich is kinda bs cuz they did. Maybe with a bit of delay but definitely not life changing.).</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h3>On his birthday he got a new phone from me a few small accessories for it and i offered him to fuck me cuz i mean come on it was his birthday (usually not into getting fucked tbh).
                        For my birthday i got, small things, 80 bucks and not even seeing him :)
                        He didn't even bother to at least do lewd stuff on phone to at least compensate for not even giving me any sexual things irl. Since he didn't wanted to meet.</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Idk he will argue about this and i know it but idc this is my website i write whatever i want. If he thinks he is wrong he can make his own one and write it however he sees this whole thing.
                        Trains went as normal and all he could have come here celebrate my birthday and all but he didn't even consider that. I fulfilled sexual things for him at his birthday, he didn't on mine. Feels unfair compared to what i made for him, i got basically nothing.</h3>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Will not invest that much in his birthday this year because i really think this stuff should be equal. If its not then i dont see a reason why i should get him many things, visit him, and all that. 
                        So on his birthday I'll stay here meeting with others if i have to, anything to not meet. It's unfair so i am unfair back. Just had to get this off of my mind. Thanksss:3</h3>
