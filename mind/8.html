                    <h3>I miss so many people I used to talk to years ago. I miss the time when I still went to school and had so much free time to hangout with so cool dudes and dudettes. It was literally a insanely nice time for me I have to admit.</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>I used to have so deep conversations with like minded people that loved talking to me just as much as I loved to talk to them. I want this back somehow, I miss interactions but even more having people with the same interests like me that care about my hobbies and all.</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>I want people being interested in what I do and what I like. Makes me feel empty not having that right now.</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>My ex and I were like, idk we had so many things in common that we shared interests in. Currently I do not have such thing but yeh I guess fine. Just need to find more friends and spend more time with those.</h3>
