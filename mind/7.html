                    <h3>Last week me and my boyfriend talked about some problems we have with each other so I used that opportunity to tell him that it pisses me off that we are barely intimate whenever we call or text. With my ex I used to do a ton of horny shit, jerking off in calls and giving instructions and all sorts of little games. That was honestly fun yeah.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>But with my current partner he got like 0 interest in doing stuff with me. Kinda hurts and makes me feel unwanted, but what’s even worse for me is that it makes this whole things fucking boring.
						Back with my ex we had so much freaking fun doing so many things, sending random videos with cumtributes to things and sending nudes with whatever.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>I really miss that if I’m honest with you guys. I do not miss my ex, there are reasons why we separated ways. But I sure miss the fun we had, both overhorny as hell both degenerates and having fun with that.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>It also had a good site, I was so horny but I got the chance to relieve it with someone and wasn’t horny afterwards.
						Currently I am horny, and that holds on for the entire week and pisses me off. Because I have no one to let it out with or “play” with, means my head is constantly full with that stuff the entire week and I am just forced to keep it to myself.</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>Again I don’t want my ex back, but I sure would not complain about having the opportunity to go back in time and have this fun once more. It was awesome and really fun.</h3>
					<br>
					<h3>Just had to rant about this a little bit here since i don't know if i will be telling this my therapist when i get back into therapy soon. So i just post it here yeye!</h3>
