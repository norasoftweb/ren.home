                <h3>I absolutely hate loud noises. Like literally if someone is in the same room as me screaming  I would just feel the urge to walk up to that person and bash their head open(not literal:D).
                    I cannot stand loud noises.</h3>

                    <h3>I also can’t stand someone whisteling next to me, in the room next to me or people shaking their leg making noises. I assume that has something to do with a mental illness. I should probably  get this checked at some point since I notice it getting worse day by day. This is concerning me.</h3>
