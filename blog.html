					<h3>Havent been too active here lately but again still working on it to get ass to write down stuff in this blog.</h3>
					<h3>This weekend sucked mad ass idk didnt meet with partner and just sat around play shit ass games having nothing better to do.</h3>
					<h3>Also the weather was so ass that i could not really do anything outside.</h3>
					<h3>Plus can't really do much with my bf in calls like lewd stuff, i am so horny this time of a year and i have no way to let it out.</h3>
					<h3>Usually before i got in this relationship i had people to sext with all day and make lewd jokes, fantasize and all that.</h3>
					<h3>Bf doesnt care too much about that stuff and is basically sexually dead. Kinda feels terrible to not have someone to be as intimate as i want.</h3>
					<h3>Maybe i should meet someone at some point that can meet on a long term as well so i have someone i can relief to or with. Idk bout that right tho.</h3>
					<h3>It's frustrating especially since my ex was as lewd as me, and if i am honest i miss that. I don't miss my ex, but the intimacy.</h3>

					<h3>Sooo nice start in the new year already ha, ha, ha.</h3>
					<h3>We were laying in bed he wanted to jerk off, so he did and i helped him a lil doing it for him for like 5 minutes.</h3>
					<h3>After he finished i wanted to do the same.</h3>
					<h3>So he just turned around got pissed or something, and didnt pay attention to me anymore.</h3>
					<h3>I was kinda confused because i literally dont know what i have done wrong but ok i guess.</h3>
					<h3>Kinda fucked up start in this probably shit year but okay. Thanks for the help champ.</h3>

					<h3>So today my bf acts like an absolute asshole once again.</h3>
					<h3>Explaining, he plays this shit ass phonegame called clash royale or something and he used to spend money on it:)</h3>
					<h3>Back then i deleted his account so he would stop wasting his fucking money on it.</h3>
					<h3>Now he made a new account trying to hide that he did and probably wastes money once again, or will in the future.</h3>
					<h3>Kind of pisses me off a lot and i clearly showed that but ok i guess.</h3>

                    <h3>Sooo Today was chrismtas eve and the whole family came together to celebrate it.</h3>
					<h3>Well kinda whole family, my bf wasnt here he was with his family.</h3>
					<h3>We barely even talked today not even texting. I find that a bit annoying.</h3>
					<h3>Christmas means more to me than my birthday and me and my "partner" did not talk a lot on that day.</h3>
					<h3>Feels weird ngl, but moving on.</h3>
					<h3>Ive spent the time with family and some friends, we all drank wine and beer and ate some good selfmade cookies.</h3>
					<h3>Gosh those were so freaking good.</h3>
					<h3>Oh and the gifts i got were all like money lmao.</h3>
					<h3>Got one special gift from a close friend tho wich was cool.</h3>
					<h3>All in all okayish day but could have been way better, weakest chrismas in years.</h3>
