					<h3>Work was alright today, came home all day horny as fuck and have literally no one to be horny with. Fucks my mood so much it just mentally destroys me as well. I regret a lot of decisions i made to land here. Anyway
					Let's move on for now, theres no point in bragging about it here too much. Have a good one guys!</h3>

					<h3>Havent been too active here lately but again still working on it to get ass to write down stuff in this blog.
					This weekend sucked mad ass idk didnt meet with partner and just sat around play shit ass games having nothing better to do.
					Also the weather was so ass that i could not really do anything outside.
					Plus can't really do much with my bf in calls like lewd stuff, i am so horny this time of a year and i have no way to let it out.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h3>Usually before i got in this relationship i had people to sext with all day and make lewd jokes, fantasize and all that.
					Bf doesnt care too much about that stuff and is basically sexually dead. Kinda feels terrible to not have someone to be as intimate as i want.
					Maybe i should meet someone at some point that can meet on a long term as well so i have someone i can relief to or with. Idk bout that right tho.
					It's frustrating especially since my ex was as lewd as me, and if i am honest i miss that. I don't miss my ex, but the intimacy.</h3>

					<h3>Sooo nice start in the new year already ha, ha, ha.
					We were laying in bed he wanted to jerk off, so he did and i helped him a lil doing it for him for like 5 minutes.
					After he finished i wanted to do the same.
					So he just turned around got pissed or something, and didnt pay attention to me anymore.
					I was kinda confused because i literally dont know what i have done wrong but ok i guess.
					Kinda fucked up start in this probably shit year but okay. Thanks for the help champ.</h3>
