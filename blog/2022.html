                        <h3>School was alright, we didn’t do much but watched movies so that was cool.
                        My plan for today is meet with friends later and have a good evening with some alcohol and enjoy the view on top of some hill we will be doing it at. I made some cookies to eat for us so that will be a blast.</h3>

                        <h3>Today is chill as heck! I got up, met with friends at a restaurant and had dinner there, got home and drank some beers with my dad while talking about Formula 1 stuff and now I’m just sitting in my room about to get in a discord call with my little cutie bf and play some left 4 dead 2 with our friends!. Planing on going to the bar with some other friends this evening, but I won’t stress myself hehe.</h3>

                        <h3>Hmm this day is odd but I ain’t complaining haha. I was meeting with a close friend in the woods, we chilled at a small river nearby listening to the sounds of the water and he gave me head:3 after that he jerked off while I was huffing and sniffing his butt hehe. Pretty nice day so far! Currently we are chilling at my place but now will go out to eat some ice cream and after that he will probably sit on my face while playing videogames for the rest of the day! :o</h3>

                        <h3>Today was very chill! Me and by friends were hanging out in the woods going for a hike. We went to some lake nearby ate there, had a few beers and walked back home a few hours later. I sure am exhausted from this trip but it was a nice one. I like to be in the woods so much.</h3>

                        <h3>Today was insane! I was at school, got home and celebrated my birthday with my friends. We talked a lot too, I love these deeptalks. I got money, a swiss army knife, and some good old alcohol haha.</h3>
