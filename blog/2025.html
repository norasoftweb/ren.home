					<h2>30th December 2025 / 6:00Pm</h2>
					<h3>So today my bf acts like an absolute asshole once again.
					Explaining, he plays this shit ass phonegame called clash royale or something and he used to spend money on it:)
					Back then i deleted his account so he would stop wasting his fucking money on it.
					Now he made a new account trying to hide that he did and probably wastes money once again, or will in the future.
					Kind of pisses me off a lot and i clearly showed that but ok i guess.</h3>

                    <h3>Sooo Today was chrismtas eve and the whole family came together to celebrate it.
					Well kinda whole family, my bf wasnt here he was with his family.
					We barely even talked today not even texting. I find that a bit annoying.
					Christmas means more to me than my birthday and me and my "partner" did not talk a lot on that day.
					Feels weird ngl, but moving on.</h3>
					&nbsp
					<h3>Ive spent the time with family and some friends, we all drank wine and beer and ate some good selfmade cookies.
					Gosh those were so freaking good.
					Oh and the gifts i got were all like money lmao.
					Got one special gift from a close friend tho wich was cool.
					All in all okayish day but could have been way better, weakest chrismas in years.</h3>
