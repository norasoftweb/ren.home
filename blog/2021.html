                        <h2>Saturday / July 31st / 6.00Pm</h2>
                        <h3>This feels so surreal, I finally moved to my father now. A few days ago my mom would freak out at the dinner table about how retarded I am and stuff, she yelled that if I am so much happier at my dads place I should live there.
                        So I called my father and today at 11 in the morning he came here to pick me up. This feels good but so unreal, my mom seemed a bit mentally fucked up about all of this but I mean she was the one giving me the motivation to do this so who cares I guess.
                        I want to be serious, I am so fucking happy. Finally not getting beaten up anymore, finally freedom, finally privacy, finally someone who cares about me. This is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. Thanks to my dad for helping me to get out of this abusive household.</h3>
